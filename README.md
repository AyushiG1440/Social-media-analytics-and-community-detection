# Social-media-analytics-and-community-detection
This is a repository of python scripts as a submission for Btech Final Year Project on the topic ' Social media analytics - community detection ' under VJTI CoE-CNDS.
We have used twitter networks and Gephi software to implement the project. 

Problem Statement:
The popularity of internet-based social media has made it possible for people to communicate with each other at any time and anywhere freely. People can create content, share information, comment on interesting issues and build connections with any person that they like. Thus, social media has accumulated a large number of data about usersâ€™ interacting behaviors and their social relationships, which implies big value. The proposed work aims to apply community detection models and to analyze information flow. Twitter is the Social media platform used.
